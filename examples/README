The example programs in this section can be compiled using make and
the make file Makefile.  

make intlCount.tst
  Compiles and runs the example in Section 2.1 of the Hancock manual.
  This test runs the program on the data in 
               data/calls/binary/calls10
  which contains two international calls.  This data is
  generated from the data in
	 	data/calls/ascii/calls10.a
  using the program data/a2b.

make intlCountCust.tst
  Compiles and runs the example in Section 2.2 of the Hancock manual.
  It then compiles and runs the program intlMapView, which iterates
  over the map created by the first program and reports all phone
  numbers that made international calls.  It again uses the sample
  data in data/calls/binary/calls10.  

  It reports that two numbers each made one international call:

  2222332099 ==> 1
  2232340199 ==> 1

  You may create your own data files by creating an ascii file of the
  form found in  data/calls/ascii/calls10.a and then using the program
  data/a2b to convert the data to binary. 

make ip.tst
  Compiles and runs the example in Section 2.3 of the Hancock manual.
  When run over the list of ip addresses and ip packet traces in the
  directory data, the output should match that in data/ip.sample.out.

make wireless.tst
  Compiles and runs the example in Chapter 13 of the Hancock manual.
  This test uses the auxiliary program wirelessGen.exe to create an
  empty directory. When run over the list of wireless call detail
  records in data/extended/wcd, the output should match that in
  data/extended/extended.sample.out.
